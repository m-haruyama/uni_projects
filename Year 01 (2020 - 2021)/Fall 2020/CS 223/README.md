# Spaceship Navigation System
# Fall 2020
A spaceship navigation system that I made for my CS 223 (Scientific Programming in C) class my first semester.
This was essentially a baby's first steps into the realm of independent programming. 
We briefly touched on the SDLC but not enough to draw anything useful from until the next semester.
