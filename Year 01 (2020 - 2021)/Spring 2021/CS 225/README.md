# Surface to Air Saviors - Tower Defense
# Spring 2021
A spinoff of the classic Atari game 'Missile Command' that I made for my CS 225 (Object Oriented Programming) class my second semester.
Admittedly a little rough around the edges, but nonetheless a very rewarding experience.
It was my first real introduction to the SDLC and my first experience as an indepndent game developer.
It also homed in my fluency in Java and JavaFX.
