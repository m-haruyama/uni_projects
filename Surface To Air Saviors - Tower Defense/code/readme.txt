I was surprised at how much I would enjoy game development using JavaFX.
Would I ever want to develop a game again? Probably not.
Could I do it if I had to again? Probably so.

Anyways, hope this spin-off of Missile Command is to your liking, Dr. Garfield.
At the very least, it's better than whatever shitstorm would have come from a ballistics simulator.
