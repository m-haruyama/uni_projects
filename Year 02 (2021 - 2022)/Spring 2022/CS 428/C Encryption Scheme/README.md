// This program will prompt the user to either encrypt or decrypt a message.
// This program will read any key written in a text file called "key.txt"
// This program will encrypt any plaintext written in a text file called "plain.txt"
// An example "plain.txt" and "key.txt" will be provided.
// This program will create a text file called "cipher.txt" that contains the encrypted plaintext.
// This program will decrypt any ciphertext written in a text file called "cipher.txt".
// This program will create a text file called "msg.txt" that contains the decrypted ciphertext.
// Please ignore the errors about the segment arrays; the program still functions with the errors.

// Example plaintext: 
This is a generic plaintext that will be encrypted by the program and produce a text file called "cipher.txt".
Hopefully it works.

// Example key:
Phineas the lobster found a kumquat in his grandmother's closet next to the meat grinder.
